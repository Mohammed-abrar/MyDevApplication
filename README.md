# Online Complaint Box
#About know yourself
This is an application to help the common poeple to register complaint .
The main aim of this project is to develop an application, which used to inform and send immediate complaint to the police station for crimes which are happening to their nearby locations.With this system, users have to just identify the type of crime such as robbery, theft, bank robbery etc. and just they have to enter their name, email or Mobile number and details about complaint. This message will be forwarded to police station. However users can also specify the location of incident or crime and after this, message will be directly forwarded to the location of that particular police station. After forwarding message, users have option to get status by login in to application. Userâ€™s information will be kept confidential and if any help needed by police in future, then they will use their mobile number or email as a medium of contact and communication. Admin have option to update status about every complaint.
